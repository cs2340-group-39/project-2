Welcome to CSGroup 39's Project 2: The Spotify Wrap project!

To get started, follow the instructions below to run the project:
1. Make sure you have Docker installed and Docker Desktop (recommended)
2. Open a terminal in the project2 folder, then run the command: "docker build -t cs2340-project-2-image ./"
3. If you are on Windows, run "./run.bat", and if you are on Mac or Linux, run "./run.sh"

Once you are in Docker, go to VSCode and attach the Docker container in a new VSCode window by clicking
on the blue button in the bottom left of the screen

Then, open a new Terminal in VSCode and CD into the frontend and run "npx expo start --tunnel"
Open another Terminal in VSCode and CD into the backend and run create a new Python environment:
1. Run "python3 -m venv"
2. Run "source ./venv/bin/activate"
3. Install all of the requirements in "requirements.txt" by running "pip install -r requirements.txt" if not done already

Now, run the script run.sh by running "./run.sh"

Localhost 8081 will be the React Native frontend generated by the npx line, and the backend link will be generated by run.sh.
